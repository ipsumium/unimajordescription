    <h2>What You'll Study</h2>
    <p>The Engineering Physics program is designed for students who have an interest in and an aptitude for both engineering and physics. Students start with a year mathematics (MATH 50 or CME 100 series) and a year of calculus-based physics. Although AP
        Physics C credit may be applied for PHYS 41 and possibly 43, students with AP credit are strongly encouraged to consider the PHYS 60 series. Although either the CME 100 or Math 50 series satisfies the requirements for the Engineering Physics major,
        the Math 50 sequence is recommended for students who are likely to choose the Physics course options for depth courses. The core of this program adds more advanced mathematics, advanced mechanics and dynamics, E&amp;M, numerical methods, an electronics
        lab, quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, a project design course, and a WIM course. Students can then choose three elective courses from a specialty area (Aerospace Physics, Biophysics, Computational Science, Electromechanical System Design,
        Energy Systems, Materials Science, Photonics, Renewable Energy). The program requires at least 45 units of math+physics and 45 units of engineering, and a Technology in Society course.
